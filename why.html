      <h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
      <p>
        Robotics is the science of designing, building, and programming machines called robots. But it’s much more than that. It’s a fun and creative way to learn science, technology, engineering, and mathematics — what we call STEM. Robotics helps us learn by doing. Instead of just reading theories in books, we actually get to build things, test them, and fix them if they don’t work. This makes learning practical and exciting. Robotics also teaches us how to solve problems. Whether it’s getting a robot to move in the right direction or making it pick up an object, we learn to think logically, experiment with ideas, and never give up — even when things don’t work at first. It also encourages creativity. You’re not just following instructions; you’re inventing, designing, and building something new from your imagination.
      </p>
      <div class="read-more-content">
        <p>
          For <strong>students</strong>, robotics is an engaging way to dive into STEM, allowing them to create robots that can perform tasks like navigating mazes or responding to sensors. This hands-on experience makes learning interactive and memorable, fostering a love for discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Parents</strong> will appreciate how robotics sparks curiosity and builds resilience in their children. By working through challenges, students develop a growth mindset, learning to iterate and improve their designs, which prepares them for real-world problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <strong>educators</strong>, robotics is a powerful tool to make STEM education dynamic. It aligns with initiatives like the National Education Policy 2020, encouraging experiential learning and helping students connect theoretical concepts to practical applications.

      <h2>Robotics & AI</h2>
      <p>
        Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are closely related fields, but they are not the same. Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. AI gives robots the ability to act smartly, enabling decision-making and learning. The following table illustrates their relationship:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Robotics</th>
          <th>Artificial Intelligence</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Physical machines that can perform tasks</td>
          <td>Software that simulates human intelligence</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Build robots that can perform mechanical tasks</td>
          <td>Make machines (including robots) think and learn</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>AI gives robots the ability to act smartly (decision-making, learning)</td>
          <td>AI can be used in many fields, but in robotics, it helps make robots autonomous</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        <strong>Real-Life Examples:</strong> Self-driving cars combine robotics (sensors, mechanical parts) with AI (decision-making, path planning). Humanoid robots like Sophia use robotics for physical movement and AI for facial recognition and conversation. In summary, robotics provides the hardware (the body), while AI provides the intelligence (the brain).
      </p>
      <div class="read-more-content">
        <p>
          <strong>Students</strong> can explore the synergy of robotics and AI by programming robots to perform intelligent tasks, such as recognizing objects or adapting to new environments. For example, they can create a robot that uses AI to detect obstacles and adjust its path, introducing them to cutting-edge technologies shaping the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <strong>parents</strong>, robotics and AI education equips their children with skills for high-demand careers in fields like autonomous vehicles, healthcare robotics, and smart manufacturing. This ensures they are prepared for a technology-driven world, with opportunities in industries that are rapidly growing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Educators</strong> can use robotics and AI to teach complex concepts like machine learning in an accessible way. By incorporating projects like programming a robot to respond to voice commands, educators align with initiatives like Atal Tinkering Labs, fostering innovation and critical thinking in the classroom.
