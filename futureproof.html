      <h2>How Can Someone with No Interest in Robotics Start?</h2>
      <p>
        Starting robotics doesn’t require an initial interest in robots—it begins with curiosity and connecting robotics to your passions. Here’s how:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start with Curiosity, Not Robotics:</strong> Explore what excites you—music, games, cars, or animals—and see how robotics fits. Love music? Make a robot that plays sounds. Like sports? Try a robo-soccer challenge. Enjoy games? Program a robot to play with you.</li>
          <li><strong>Treat It Like a Toy, Not a Subject:</strong> Interest grows through play. Tinker with projects like a voice-activated robot car, a clap-activated light, or a DIY bug that scurries around. Experiment, break, fix, and explore without pressure.</li>
          <li><strong>Show the "Why", Not Just the "How":</strong> Robotics is inspiring when you see its impact—robots perform surgeries, save lives, clean oceans, and drive Teslas. Discover what robots can achieve to spark your interest.</li>
          <li><strong>Robotics is Hidden in Other Skills:</strong> Start with coding through games, design through art, or logic through puzzles, then apply these to robotics. These indirect paths make robotics approachable and fun.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <div class="read-more-content">
        <p>
          <strong>For Students:</strong> Don’t worry if robots seem complex—start with fun projects tied to your hobbies, like a robot that dances to your favorite song.
